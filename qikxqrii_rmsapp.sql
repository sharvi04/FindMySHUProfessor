With this CMS, you can easily add, delete, and edit images and text on your site. You can also create an unlimited number of pages, galleries, events, product pages, blog posts, and implement a simple site search. What makes our Modular CMS stand out is its built-in mechanism for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Social Media Optimization (SMO).

The beauty of this CMS is its adaptability to any design. We have cleverly utilized the Route technique to make it compatible with any JavaScript framework (Angular, ReactJS, AstroJS) or simple libraries like jQuery, Handlebars, and MustacheJS. For the front-end, we use the Laravel Blade template, which allows you to choose any HTML5 layout and define regions to create your website template in minutes.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We\\u2019ve been using CMS tools like Joomla, Drupal, and WordPress since 2003. Leveraging this experience, we created ModularCMS, which is quick to implement, easy to manage, and scalable as websites grow. In essence, it combines the best features from the top CMS tools we\\u2019ve worked with. We are proud to introduce ModularCMS, the culmination of 5 years of development and 20 years of CMS expertise, via DGBITS.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Laravel-based Website Development</h2>\\r\\n<p>At DGBITS, we stay ahead of the competition by developing custom Laravel websites designed to achieve new levels of profitability. We can build custom features into your site using Laravel or help create a customized website with our Laravel-based CMS.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Headless CMS</h2>\\r\\n<p>Headless CMSs are ideal for businesses that need a content management system that is highly customizable and manageable without necessarily requiring a front-end website. These include businesses in the media, entertainment, publishing, and eCommerce sectors, as well as those needing to manage content for internal processes. A headless CMS offers scalability, flexibility, and efficiency, making it easier to manage content across multiple channels. It gives developers the freedom to choose their preferred front-end tools and enhances security by separating the content layer from the presentation layer.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With a headless CMS, you can enjoy faster editing experiences, enhanced content management, and streamlined scalability for your business. Whether you\\u2019re looking for internal content management or an external-facing website, a headless CMS gives you the freedom to work with the best technologies available.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Strapi as a Headless CMS</h3>\\r\\n<p>Many corporate sites have been traditionally built with CMSs like WordPress or Drupal, which combine both the front-end and back-end into one system. Headless CMSs like Strapi separate the two, allowing you to build your front-end freely while managing your content effectively. Strapi simplifies the creation and management of websites with pages for blogs, projects, case studies, and more. It handles both the database and content management system for you, enabling seamless integration and content delivery.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Why Choose DGBITS for CMS Solutions?</h2>\\r\\n<p>Our specialists at DGBITS provide ongoing support and maintenance to ensure that your website stays up-to-date, secure, and fully functional.

With this CMS, you can easily add, delete, and edit images and text on your site. You can also create an unlimited number of pages, galleries, events, product pages, blog posts, and implement a simple site search. What makes our Modular CMS stand out is its built-in mechanism for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Social Media Optimization (SMO). With every webpage you create, you can easily share it with your audience through popular social media channels such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Google+. Social sharing is a key feature and a crucial success factor for your website\\u2019s growth. Thanks to our Modular CMS, you can have a highly professional website at a very reasonable price!</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>ModularCMS: Our Proprietary CMS</h3>\\r\\n<p>ModularCMS is our proprietary CMS built on Laravel and MySQL. The beauty of this CMS is its adaptability to any design. We have cleverly utilized the Route technique to make it compatible with any JavaScript framework (Angular, ReactJS, AstroJS) or simple libraries like jQuery, Handlebars, and MustacheJS. For the front-end, we use the Laravel Blade template, which allows you to choose any HTML5 layout and define regions to create your website template in minutes.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We\\u2019ve been using CMS tools like Joomla, Drupal, and WordPress since 2003. Leveraging this experience, we created ModularCMS, which is quick to implement, easy to manage, and scalable as websites grow. In essence, it combines the best features from the top CMS tools we\\u2019ve worked with. We are proud to introduce ModularCMS, the culmination of 5 years of development and 20 years of CMS expertise, via DGBITS.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Laravel-based Website Development</h2>\\r\\n<p>At DGBITS, we stay ahead of the competition by developing custom Laravel websites designed to achieve new levels of profitability. We can build custom features into your site using Laravel or help create a customized website with our Laravel-based CMS.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Headless CMS</h2>\\r\\n<p>Headless CMSs are ideal for businesses that need a content management system that is highly customizable and manageable without necessarily requiring a front-end website. These include businesses in the media, entertainment, publishing, and eCommerce sectors, as well as those needing to manage content for internal processes. A headless CMS offers scalability, flexibility, and efficiency, making it easier to manage content across multiple channels. It gives developers the freedom to choose their preferred front-end tools and enhances security by separating the content layer from the presentation layer.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With a headless CMS, you can enjoy faster editing experiences, enhanced content management, and streamlined scalability for your business. Whether you\\u2019re looking for internal content management or an external-facing website, a headless CMS gives you the freedom to work with the best technologies available.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Strapi as a Headless CMS</h3>\\r\\n<p>Many corporate sites have been traditionally built with CMSs like WordPress or Drupal, which combine both the front-end and back-end into one system. Headless CMSs like Strapi separate the two, allowing you to build your front-end freely while managing your content effectively. Strapi simplifies the creation and management of websites with pages for blogs, projects, case studies, and more. It handles both the database and content management system for you, enabling seamless integration and content delivery.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Why Choose DGBITS for CMS Solutions?</h2>\\r\\n<p>Our specialists at DGBITS provide ongoing support and maintenance to ensure that your website stays up-to-date, secure, and fully functional.

A headless CMS consists of an API and back-end technology that stores and delivers content to your desired front end, which is most likely not going to be apparent to the end-user. The difference between a headless CMS and a traditional CMS is only visible on the back end of the site. This means that storage and delivery are managed by separate software. With dedicated tools for, on the one hand, authoring and organizing data, and on the other, and presenting users with that data, each part of the system can focus on its specialty, and your workflow can become more streamlined.\\r\\n\\r\\n                          </p><p class=\\\"px-4 text-wrap text-justify\\\">  A headless CMS does not have a defined front-end system or presentation environment.

Hybrid apps allow developers to write one codebase that applies to all operating systems, which is very cost-effective.\\r\\n                        </p>\\r\\n                        <h3>Why Choose Hybrid Apps?</h3>\\r\\n                        <ul>\\r\\n                            <li>One unified codebase for multiple platforms.</li>\\r\\n                            <li>Cost-efficient with high reusability of code (up to 80%).</li>\\r\\n                            <li>Delivers similar UI/UX as native apps.</li>\\r\\n                            <li>Equally capable of working across all major platforms.</li>\\r\\n                            <li>Time-efficient development process.</li>\\r\\n                        </ul>\\r\\n                        <h3>Contact Us</h3>\\r\\n                        <p>\\r\\n                            Got an idea for a hybrid mobile app?

Even if you manage to get your website to appear at the top of search results, you will likely need to continue monitoring results and implementing measures, especially if your competition is also making use of search engine optimisation. If your competition improves its position in the search results, it could be at your expense.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>On-page SEO is the practice of optimising your page\\u2019s content to ensure that it looks great in the eyes of search engines like Google.

In addition, you can have an unlimited number of pages, galleries, events, project or product pages, blog posts, and a simple site search. What makes Modular CMS stand out? The built-in mechanism for Search Engine Optimization and Social Media Optimization.

In a nutshell, it\'s a mash-up of the best features from the top three CMS tools that we\'ve liked so far. We have the necessary expertise and vision to move this forward.

This includes businesses in the media, entertainment, publishing, and eCommerce industries, as well as companies that need to manage a lot of content for internal processes. Businesses in these industries can benefit from the scalability, flexibility, and efficiency that headless CMSs provide. A headless CMS is a powerful and flexible way to manage content.

Spreadsheets that aren’t in order? Unorganized LinkedIn connections? Stop managing your relationships in silos. \r\n        <strong>SwiftCRM</strong> is simple to learn and allows you to track every detail of your business relationships in one place. Manage your entire sales pipeline as well as organize and respond to all customer support issues with the same tool, including Quick Estimates and detailed Invoices with Payment Gateway integration.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>What is CRM?</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n        <strong>CRM</strong> stands for <em>Customer Relationship Management</em>. This technology is used by organizations of all sizes to support and maintain client connections. \r\n        CRM technology enhances various aspects of the customer lifecycle, including marketing, sales, commerce, support, and IT. It is commonly used in both B2B companies \r\n        (across industries such as high tech, manufacturing, financial services, and healthcare) and B2C companies (in consumer goods and retail).\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        A CRM system enables businesses to manage customer and prospect relationships using data. Customer and prospect information—such as contact details, account information, \r\n        sales opportunities, service cases, and marketing campaigns—can be stored, tracked, and analyzed in one central location. Organizations benefit from having data in one place, \r\n        providing a complete view of customers and prospects, which can be shared and analyzed in real-time by teams across the company.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Connect with SwiftCRM to Convert Visitors in Real Time</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n        With <strong>SwiftCRM</strong>, you can use live chat to engage with visitors in real time and scale your conversations with chatbots. SwiftCRM provides free-form tools that help \r\n        convert visitors into qualified leads, attract more traffic to your site, and grow your database. SwiftCRM will automatically organize, enrich, and track each contact, helping you manage relationships efficiently and effectively.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Using SwiftCRM to handle contacts and sales activities has shown to:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Increase win rates by <strong>76%</strong></li>\r\n        <li>Boost sales productivity by <strong>66%</strong></li>\r\n        <li>Increase revenue by <strong>70%</strong></li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        Find out how SwiftCRM is dedicated to your success and learn how we can support your growth by helping you attract, retain, and win consumers.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Key Features</h3>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Schedule Calls and Meetings</li>\r\n        <li>Create Tasks for Companies/Contacts</li>\r\n        <li>Add Multiple Contacts</li>\r\n        <li>Add Multiple Companies</li>\r\n        <li>Add Notes/Descriptions to Companies/Contacts</li>\r\n        <li>Generate Activity and Growth Reports</li>\r\n        <li>View Detailed Activity Logs</li>\r\n        <li>Send Custom Emails</li>\r\n        <li>Open, Win, and Close Deals</li>\r\n        <li>Connect Invoices to Deals</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</div>', '', '', '<img class=\"img-fluid rounded mt-3\" src=\"/media/uploads/human-resource_FJZDcYw.jpeg\" alt=\"Human Resource\" style=\"width: 100%; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\" />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"feature-box-01\" style=\"margin: 1rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 10px; background-color: #f9f9f9;\">\r\n    <i class=\"ti-user display-19\" style=\"font-size: 2rem; color: #333;\"></i>\r\n    <h3 class=\"display-28 mt-3\" style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1rem; font-weight: bold; color: #444;\">Contacts</h3>\r\n    <p class=\"text-justify text-wrap\" style=\"font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #666;\">\r\n        Add unlimited contacts to your CRM with detailed information, including company, currency, acquisition stage, and contact owner. \r\n        You can define acquisition sources for each contact to get insights into which marketing efforts or platforms yield the best results.\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"feature-box-01\" style=\"margin: 1rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 10px; background-color: #f9f9f9;\">\r\n    <i class=\"ti-receipt display-19\" style=\"font-size: 2rem; color: #333;\"></i>\r\n    <h3 class=\"display-28 mt-3\" style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1rem; font-weight: bold; color: #444;\">Generate Invoices</h3>\r\n    <p class=\"text-justify text-wrap\" style=\"font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #666;\">\r\n        Connect invoices to contacts in your CRM and easily reconcile transactions for accurate accounting.

Using this CMS, you can easily add, delete, and edit images and text on your website. In addition, you can have an unlimited number of pages, galleries, events, project or product pages, blog posts, and a simple site search. What makes Modular CMS stand out? The built-in mechanism for Search Engine Optimization and Social Media Optimization. When you create a webpage, you can easily share it with your audience via your social media channels (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Google+, and so on). Social Sharing is a key feature of our Modular CMS and an important success factor for your website. So with our Modular CMS, you can have a highly professional website at a very reasonable price!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">\r\n    We\'ve been using CMS tools like Joomla, Drupal, and WordPress since 2003. With that knowledge, we created this richly featured ModularCMS. It is simple to create templates, quick to work with multiple content types, and robust to maintain websites as they grow in size. In a nutshell, it\'s a mash-up of the best features from the top three CMS tools that we\'ve liked so far. We have the necessary expertise and vision to move this forward. We are pleased to introduce ModularCMS via DGBITS. It is the culmination of 5 years of hard work and 20 years of CMS expertise.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">Laravel Based Website Development</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">\r\n    We keep ahead of the competition by developing custom Laravel Websites that set new records of profitability. We can build custom features into your website using Laravel or help create a custom website using Laravel-based CMS.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">Headless CMS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\r\n    Headless CMSs are best suited for businesses that need a content management system that is highly customizable and easily managed but don\'t necessarily need a front-end website. This includes businesses in the media, entertainment, publishing, and eCommerce industries, as well as companies that need to manage a lot of content for internal processes. Businesses in these industries can benefit from the scalability, flexibility, and efficiency that headless CMSs provide. A headless CMS is a powerful and flexible way to manage content. It allows for faster editing experiences and the ability to manage content across multiple channels. It offers developers the flexibility to choose their own front-end tooling and makes it easier to scale. In addition, headless CMS also offers enhanced security by separating content from the presentation layer.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">\r\n    The DGBITS support team will ensure you can continue to add content to your website with confidence. Regularly updating the CMS software with patches as they become available will ensure you have peace of mind. When it comes to online security, peace of mind is something that’s always worth having.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">Strapi As Headless CMS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\r\n    Most corporate sites have been built using a traditional CMS like WordPress or Drupal. These CMSs can be seen as “monolithic” as the front-end and back-end are packed into one system. Headless CMSs like Strapi allow you to decouple the two and give you the freedom to choose however you want to build your front-end. Creating a site with pages for blogs, projects, case studies, and other content requires not only the database but also a system to easily create and manage it. Strapi handles all of that for you.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1rem;\">\r\n    DGBITS specialists offer support and maintenance services to make websites available to the online world and get them updated and running smoothly. Moreover, our solutions are cost-effective and provide value for your money, with the highest level of accuracy in our services. Website maintenance ensures the website stays fresh and updated for visitors visiting your site. Such sites are able to get more traffic and hence establish good communication with your potential clients and other members.\r\n</p>', '', '', '<div class=\"card card-shadow overflow-hidden mt-2\">\r\n    <div class=\"row no-gutters card-shadow\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-12 bg-white\">\r\n            <div style=\"padding: 0;\">\r\n                <img src=\"/media/uploads/cms-styles.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"CMS Styles\">\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"card-body\">\r\n            <h4 class=\"title text-center\" style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">Why Headless CMS</h4>\r\n            <p style=\"padding: 1rem; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1rem;\">\r\n                While it may sound intimidating at first, understanding headless CMS is actually quite straightforward. A headless CMS consists of an API and back-end technology that stores and delivers content to your desired front end, which is most likely not going to be apparent to the end-user. The difference between a headless CMS and a traditional CMS is only visible on the back end of the site. This means that storage and delivery are managed by separate software. With dedicated tools for, on the one hand, authoring and organizing data, and on the other, presenting users with that data, each part of the system can focus on its specialty, and your workflow can become more streamlined.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p style=\"padding: 1rem; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1rem;\">\r\n                A headless CMS does not have a defined front-end system or presentation environment. By separating content production, management, and storage from distribution and display, headless increases the flexibility and security of your content.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p style=\"padding: 1rem; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1rem;\">\r\n                Choosing between headless and traditional CMS is more than just a matter of using the most cutting-edge or latest technology. It is critical to consider and evaluate not only the type of content, but also internal staff, agency involvement, and whoever will be maintaining the web property, delivery methods, and long-term maintenance.\r\n            </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>', '', '', 'uploads/banners/page-bg_Hp1eXTt.png', '', '', '', '', 'Are you looking for a CMS with no worries about website security?', 'If you answered yes?

Typical hybrid apps run across Windows, iOS, and Android devices. The most interesting aspect of hybrid app development is the time and cost efficiency generated by using a single codebase. About <strong>80% of the codebase</strong> can be reused for other operating systems, while the remaining 20% is usually specific to each operating system.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Notwithstanding that hybrid apps are developed using web technologies, they can provide a similar UI/UX as native apps, and moreover, have equal capabilities to work across several platforms. Hybrid apps allow developers to write one codebase that applies to all operating systems, which is very cost-effective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <h3>Why Choose Hybrid Apps?</h3>\r\n                        <ul>\r\n                            <li>One unified codebase for multiple platforms.</li>\r\n                            <li>Cost-efficient with high reusability of code (up to 80%).</li>\r\n                            <li>Delivers similar UI/UX as native apps.</li>\r\n                            <li>Equally capable of working across all major platforms.</li>\r\n                            <li>Time-efficient development process.</li>\r\n                        </ul>\r\n                        <h3>Contact Us</h3>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Got an idea for a hybrid mobile app?

Typically, technologies such as CSS, HTML, or JavaScript are used in their development. These technologies can be combined with open-source components of frameworks like React Native or Flutter, which can then be integrated into a native application.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            These technologies allow hybrid apps to run through the browser implemented in each platform. This enables the apps to function as both mobile apps and web apps, providing the capability to be installed on devices and made available on platforms like the Play Store or App Store.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            The hybrid approach leverages the best of both worlds by combining the web\'s versatility with the performance and user experience of native apps, making them a cost-effective and efficient solution for businesses aiming for cross-platform compatibility.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h3>Contact Us</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n            Have questions about hybrid app development?

A brand is defined as the “name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that identifies one seller’s goods or services as distinct from those of other sellers.” This means, your brand or corporate identity are the representation of your company\'s reputation through your company\'s attributes, values, purpose, strengths, passions, and products. It’s arguable that a brand is one of the most valuable assets a business can have. A brand represents your company and can have a large impact on your corporate identity. It’s important that you take creating your brand seriously, so it can properly represent your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before you attempt to define your brand, you have to define what you think your company is about. Great brands are easy to recognize. They have a clear mission and can cultivate a devoted and loyal clientele if used properly.

With over 1 billion Gmail users globally, email continues to dominate as a preferred communication channel. A staggering 75% of these users access their emails on mobile devices, showcasing the importance of crafting mobile-optimized email campaigns to reach your audience effectively.  \r\n</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDeals and discounts play a critical role in driving sales, and email is the go-to channel for consumers to discover them. Research indicates that 66% of consumers have made a purchase influenced by a marketing message they received via email. This statistic highlights the immense potential of email marketing to convert leads into paying customers.  \r\n</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nUnlike other marketing channels, email allows businesses to establish a personalized connection with their audience. Whether it’s announcing exclusive promotions, offering seasonal discounts, or sharing valuable insights, consumers actively look forward to finding special offers in their inbox. In fact, promotional emails have become a trusted resource for people seeking new deals and discovering the latest products or services.  \r\n</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMoreover, email marketing provides unparalleled flexibility and measurable results. Businesses can track open rates, click-through rates, and conversions to gain valuable insights into their campaign performance. With tools like A/B testing and segmentation, marketers can fine-tune their strategies to ensure every message resonates with its intended audience.  \r\n</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor businesses of all sizes, email marketing is a cost-effective way to nurture relationships, drive repeat sales, and build brand loyalty. By delivering the right message to the right people at the right time, you can maximize the potential of every email sent. The modern consumer is not only willing to receive promotional emails but actively seeks out brands that offer meaningful and timely communication. Make email marketing an integral part of your strategy to stay ahead in today’s competitive marketplace.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Email marketing is a classic and effective way to engage your customers and get the best conversions. It allows you to create a personal voice for your existing customer base, the people who have already expressed an interest in purchasing from your business. With Email Marketing, you can track precisely how many clients are actually opening your email. A successful email campaign can take time to build, but that’s true with any good Email Marketing plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to improve your conversions and click-through rates, we optimize emails with fluid layouts that easily fit on mobile devices. Otherwise, many users won’t be able to interact with your Email Marketing messages and will either delete or unsubscribe. If you optimize your Email Marketing for mobile, this will improve the opportunity to steal customers from other competitors.

Strategic Mobile Marketing can promote products, create brand awareness, build customer relationships, and increase sales. With more consumers on mobile, the digital world is evolving, modifying how we engage with our customers. The recent market trends indicate that we can achieve unarguable, repeated successes through Mobile Apps and Mobile Promotion & Marketing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mobile-friendly design and page speed are key factors in mobile optimization. However, these two elements by themselves don’t always add up to a perfectly optimized website or app. Many people are adopting responsive design to achieve the best mobile experience, but still, more needs to be considered to truly optimize for the needs of mobile users. The raw technical implementation of a responsive layout isn’t enough to solve this problem. Instead, our designers put themselves in the mobile user’s shoes and take into account what customers want to accomplish on a website or mobile app using a mobile phone or smart devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Mobile Marketing Optimization Services help your business earn customers for life by taking care of all your requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SMS Marketing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>SMS Marketing is essential to create better relationships with your clients.

This requires experience and ongoing work. Even if you manage to get your website to appear at the top of search results, you will likely need to continue monitoring results and implementing measures, especially if your competition is also making use of search engine optimisation. If your competition improves its position in the search results, it could be at your expense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On-page SEO is the practice of optimising your page’s content to ensure that it looks great in the eyes of search engines like Google. This includes various tasks like keyword placement, URL optimisation, content readability, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quite often, the first step in a customer’s journey towards completing any online task is via a search engine. So, it’s absolutely crucial that your site appear as high up any search engine results page (SERP) as possible. But ranking well in a SERP is not a given. It requires strategy and effort to optimise fully for search engine visibility. As an online marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords they enter, and which search engines are preferred by users. Optimising a website for search engines is crucial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will implement SEO for your content, META information, and page titles to ensure that we bring the right people to your website.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SEM & Paid Search Marketing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>SEM (Search Engine Marketing) is the process of gaining website traffic by purchasing ads on search engines. SEM is the cheapest form of advertising. It is our mission to help you reach as many people as possible for the lowest cost. Search Engine Marketing involves implementing and successfully using combined online strategies such as SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) and PPC (Pay Per Click) campaigns to position your company at the top of Google above your competitors for keywords related to your services or products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The paid ads will often appear at the top of the page when people search for your targeted keywords. Having a paid advertisement on search engines often doubles the chances of having your website clicked on compared to ranking high through organic keyword optimisation (SEO). The paid ads are referred to as “Pay-per-Click” or PPC advertising, where you will pay only if your ad is clicked on.</p>\r\n\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </article>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <!-- End Blog Left -->\r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\n            \r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</section>', '', '', '<!-- Blog Right -->\r\n<div class=\"pe-xl-4\" style=\"margin-top: 120px;\">\r\n    <div class=\"row mt-n1-9\">\r\n        <!-- Post -->\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-6 mt-1-9\">\r\n            <article class=\"card card-style1\">\r\n                <div class=\"card-image\">\r\n                    <img src=\"/media/uploads/sem.png\" alt=\"Search Engine Marketing\">\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div class=\"card-body\">\r\n                    <h1>Search Engine Marketing (SEM)</h1>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Improve your business’s online presence in search engines and drive more qualified leads. Building an organic presence through search engine optimization (SEO) is critical, so adding a paid strategy like SEM can help you create a powerful online marketing strategy that delivers a one-two punch.

The rendering of content is done externally, often through an API. Popular examples of headless CMS platforms include:\r\n                        <ul>\r\n                            <li>Strapi</li>\r\n                            <li>Directus</li>\r\n                            <li>Other JAMstack CMS</li>\r\n                        </ul>\r\n                        To display content from a headless CMS, we typically use frontend technologies like AstroJS or NextJS. These frameworks fetch the content through an API or GraphQL and render it on the frontend.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <h2>JAMstack Web Deployment</h2>\r\n                    <p>All websites we develop using <strong>JAMstack</strong> are built for performance and deployed on a <strong>Content Delivery Network (CDN)</strong>, also known as an edge network. With JAMstack, there are no traditional web servers to manage, making it an efficient, scalable solution. Additionally, the cost of deploying and hosting websites is significantly lower than traditional hosting. For smaller sites, deployment and hosting costs can even be as low as zero!</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </article>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Blog Right -->', '', '', 'uploads/banners/page-bg_0bk0wwh.png', '', '', '', '', 'Not sure what to select?
